My name is Gentian Zavalani. I am a third-year PhD student at the Institute of Numerical Mathematics, [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/numerik){:target="_blank"}, Germany. My supervisors are [Oliver Sander](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/numerik/sander/startseite){:target="_blank"} and [Michael Hecht](https://sites.google.com/view/prof-dr-michael-hecht/home?authuser=0){:target="_blank"}.

My research interests are on high-order methods for computing scalar and vector-valued functions on smooth and embedded surfaces, with particular interest in numerical integration techniques. My work is driven by applications in geometry and physics, and involves the development of fast algorithms and spectral methods for solving partial differential equations efficiently on complex domains.
