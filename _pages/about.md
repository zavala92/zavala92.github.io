My name is **Gentian Zavalani**. I am a PhD student at the Institute of Numerical Mathematics,  
[TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/numerik), Germany.  

My supervisors are [Prof. Oliver Sander](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/numerik/sander/startseite) and [Prof. Michael Hecht](https://sites.google.com/view/prof-dr-michael-hecht/home?authuser=0).  

I expect to defend my PhD thesis in **February**.


During my PhD, I focused on numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) posed on smooth two-dimensional surfaces embedded in $R^3$. My work is motivated by applications in biology and physics and involves developing fast algorithms and spectral methods for solving PDEs efficiently on complex geometries.  

It centers on three main themes:

- **High-order polynomial approximations** of curved surfaces  
- **Accurate computation of surface integrals**  
- **Fast direct solvers** for elliptic partial differential equations on static and dynamic surfaces

📘 This semester I am teaching a course on **Approximation Theory** at [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/numerik).  
The course discusses both the **theoretical foundations** and **practical aspects** of approximating and interpolating functions, with a focus on **high-order polynomials, trigonometric series, and rational functions**.  


📝 The lecture notes on Approximation Theory are available here ["Approximation Theory"](/files/Notes%20on%20Approximation%20Theory.pdf){:target="_blank"} and are continuously updated throughout the semester.
