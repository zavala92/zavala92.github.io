My name is Gentian Zavalani. I am a PhD student at the Institute of Numerical Mathematics, [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/numerik){:target="_blank"}, Germany. My supervisors are [Oliver Sander](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/numerik/sander/startseite){:target="_blank"} and [Michael Hecht](https://sites.google.com/view/prof-dr-michael-hecht/home?authuser=0){:target="_blank"}.

During my PhD, I focused on numerical methods for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) posed on smooth two-dimensional surfaces embedded in \( \mathbb{R}^3 \). My work is motivated by applications in biology and physics and involves developing fast algorithms and spectral methods for solving PDEs efficiently on complex geometries.  
It centers on three main themes:

- **High-order polynomial approximations** of curved surfaces  
- **Accurate computation of surface integrals**  
- A **fast direct solver** for elliptic partial differential equations on static and dynamic surfaces




📘 This semester I am teaching a course on **Approximation Theory** at [TU Dresden](https://tu-dresden.de/mn/math/numerik).  
The course discusses both the **theoretical foundations** and **practical aspects** of approximating and interpolating functions, with a focus on **high-order polynomials, trigonometric series, and rational functions**.  


📝 The lecture notes on Approximation Theory are available here ["Approximation Theory"](/files/Notes%20on%20Approximation%20Theory.pdf){:target="_blank"} and are continuously updated throughout the semester.
